# 2023: 52 Weeks of Working with Data in  `Python` and `R`

## Content of this respository

This repo holds the contents of the challenge I set myself for 2023:

> Finish one machine learning, data wrangling or data viz project each week of 2023 in both Python and R.

Given that both languages are complements nowadays, with R being strongest for data wrangling and visualisation and Python being the predominant language for machine learning, I believe that this challenge will be incredibly useful to gain hands-on experience.

### Week 1: Predicting Olympic Athletes' weights

|  | Description |
| :------ | :------ |
| **Data Source**      | [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-07-27/readme.md)       |
| **Goal**   | Predicting athlete weight with Elastic Net with `scikit-learn` (Python) and `tidymodels` (R) |
| **Keywords**   | Supervised Learning, Elastic Net, K-Fold Cross Validation, Hyperparameter Tuning, Parallel Processing |
| **Results**   | $R^2 \approx 74.6\%$ for `scikit-learn` and $R^2 \approx 73.5\%$ for `tidymodels`. Note that the differences are likely due to the splits and can be ignored. |
